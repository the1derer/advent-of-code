## For Every Language(by November 15 of that year)

- Setup the build system
- Write Utils
- Script that easy execute + check against o/p
- Write code to fetch + create input and sample input files
- Write blog in same language
- Fetch leaderboard(json) in same language
- Create Visualisation
- Make discord bot
- Write template/base file
- Use TDD and setup IDE
- RegEx

### Example taken from reddit(for Python) :-

Some features of the project setup:

- Solutions are timed with the help of a decorator using time.perf_counter
- Solution and time are printed to console using the rich package with truecolor
- Solution profiler decorator using Cprofile and pstats
- Automatic listing of completed solutions in the README
- Automatic changelog, using semantic versioning and the conventional commit specification
- A badge that is updated automatically with the amount of stars I've collected
- Pip installable (pip install -e .) with:
  - A generate-readme
  script, which updates the readme
  - A run-all script, which dynamically calls every solution in every adventofcode.year_*.day_* module
  - An add-day script, which add a solution day file using a template and downloads the input data from the AOC site automatically
  - A clean-repo script which removes all my solutions so you can provide your own :)
- Type checked (mypy) and linted (flake8)
- Tested against multiple python versions using tox on each push to master and pull request
- Hope you like it, and if you have any feedback or things to add let me know :)
