  Runs your solutions in watch mode (with extremely fast compilation for TS using esbuild).
  Allows you to fetch the input and send the solutions directly via terminal.
  Prevents you from sending empty solutions and incorrect solutions twice (so you won't accidentally get the time penalty).
  Provides a template for AoC solutions that you can customize.
  Takes care of loading the input, measuring solution time, and running simple unit tests (supports async and sync code).
  Automatically creates and updates README file.
